--- Disc Golf Bag ----

This is the front end of a full stack app. The app is a disc golf bag that allows the user to keep a record of the different discs that they own. 
This project was made with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express, and superagent. 
React serves as the front end and making HTTP requests to the back end server via Superagent. Express allows Node.js to manage and create endpoints.
